In a cozy little corner of the house so bright,  
Lies a kitten named Bakasura, a playful delight.  
With a coat of midnight black, sleek and grand,  
Yet his paws wear white socks, an adorable band.  

His eyes sparkle mischief, oh what a sight,  
Always on a quest, morning, noon, and night.  
A voracious appetite, he's hungry all the time,  
Nibbling on his siblings' food, he's committed the crime!  

His tummy's a bottomless pit, it's no lie,  
Every morsel disappears, as meals swiftly fly!  
Yet beyond this hunger-driven frenzy and spree,  
Is a heart full of love, vast as the sea.  

Bakasura purrs loudly, a motor running smooth,  
His cuddles are heartfelt, his love the ultimate soothe.  
In his presence, all worries do dissolve,  
A master of warmth, in every problem, he’s involved.  

He prances and leaps, an acrobat of glee,  
Through the house he dashes, happy as can be.  
His antics are endless, they cause no dismay,  
For with each little mischief, a smile, he does convey.  

Life is an adventure for this charming feline,  
In every paw-step, a world of wonder and sign.  
Such joy he brings, our hearts he does adore,  
A journey with Bakasura, forever to explore.  

A black kitten, patches of white, socks just right,  
Always hungry, always playful, hearts he does ignite.  
With his charm and delight, he's truly a star,  
Around him, laughs and cuddles regain par.  

Baksura, oh Bakasura, you wonderful cat,  
With every purr and cuddle, life’s never flat.  
You’ve stolen our hearts, and we know it's true,  
Bakasura, dear Bakasura, we truly love you!
