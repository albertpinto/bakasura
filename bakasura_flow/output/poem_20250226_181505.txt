In a world so lively and sweet,  
Lives a cat who’s light on his feet,  
A furry scamp we call Bakasura,  
Who’s lovely as a soft tempura.  

With whiskers twitching, eyes aglow,  
He prances like a playful doe.  
Curled in sunbeams, he’ll sit and stare,  
Then springs to pounce, midair flair!  

Bakasura, you’re a wizard feline,  
Your silent leaps are quite divine.  
You hunt phantoms in the hall,  
Playing like a tiny fur-ball.  

Sometimes he’s a hidden spy,  
With a tail that seems to fly.  
Mischief winks in his cat-eye glint,  
Of mice and yarn, he takes a hint.  

He stalks the house with noblesse grace,  
Yet throws himself in play's embrace.  
A gentle lord of all he sees,  
Who naps with ease, beneath the trees.  

In cupboards, he pries and scouts,  
Discovering secrets with quiet doubts.  
His favorite place, atop the fridge,  
He perches there, a feline ridge.  

At mealtimes, he prays and begs,  
With subtle shimmies, tiny dregs.  
"No morsel left behind," he purrs,  
With shadows flicked by whisker blurs.  

It’s clear he knows he’s quite adored,  
His paw in bowls, like a gourmand lord.  
You’d think he rules with iron paw,  
But cuddles mark his feline law.  

In evening’s embrace, Bakasura comes,  
With purring motors, like soft drums.  
He claims our laps, a cozy lair,  
Where purring rhythms fill the air.  

For Bakasura, a feline sage,  
Finds solace amidst his soft-linen stage.  
Whether dreamer or dancer, day or night,  
He turns boredom into pure delight.  

Life’s unpredictable, Bakasura knows,  
But with whiskers held high, he overthrows.  
He leaps through life with a joyous pace,  
A cat of charm and boundless grace.  

For he’s a king in his furry domain,  
One where joy and antics reign.  
So here’s to our dear Bakasura,  
A cat's delight, a purrful aura!
